# TF2C-Forbid-items-for-bots
Forbids listed items for bots

Forbids certain items for bots (gunboats, shock therapy and uberspritze by default).

You can modify the source file and recompile to include more items. It has a commented part of what you need to modify and that's made in a somewhat simple mini-language rather than sourcepawn. Might be particularly useful for those who run any sort of custom weapons mods which contain items that bots can't use in an appropriate manner.
